Introduction: 
_Hello! My name is Kassandra Gonzalez, and I am currently a junior attending high school. I've been interested in code as a side hobby for a while now, and I think that this class could help me learn more about coding and the different ways of formatting it._

***What is a Growth Mindset?*** 
Growth mindset is when we believe that even their most basic abilities can be developed into something greater through hard work and determination.

***3 reminders of how I can keep myself in a growth mindset:*** 
 - *Ask questions about anything I have trouble understanding anything.*
 - *Learn well, not fast. Take your time to learn what you need to learn.*
 - *Push out of your comfort zone, try new things and explore new interests!*
